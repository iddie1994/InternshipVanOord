# Introduction
This repository includes both an exploratory investment decision making model in offshore gas and a free-cash flow model that simulates the potential of large-scale offshore wind P2H. The decision making model is restricted by DSS users only and for that purpose, a free-cash flow model is made in the free Vensim PLE software and sequentially extended with the EMA-workbench in Python. It is the first publicaly available ESDMA model with the use of Vensim PLE - Feb 22'. Feel free to explore the model behaviour. 

# Vensim PLE models
Recognize the .vpmx files. These are the published Vensim models that represent the models. The 'model_inputs' files show the model inputs and formulas. 

# Python - EMA workbench application
The system dynamics (SD) models interact with the EMA workbench applied in PyCharm. The modeling method is therefore called ESDMA. As said, the workbench is made to interact with Vensim DSS, however, the integration of a Pysd (another SD python package) connector allows to interact with Vensim PLE - the unpayed version. 

The MAIN Py models are listed with a 1 in front of the filename.
The applied result methodologies during the research are listed with a 2, 3 and 4 in front of the filename.

Lastly, a txt file is added. This can be uploaded in the 'cmd prompt' to immediately install the required PyCharm packages. 

Good luck! Ids Dijkstra
