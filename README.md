ESDMA model of large-scale wind P2H
This repository includes a free-cash flow model that simulates the potential of large-scale offshore wind P2H. The model is made in Vensim PLE and enriched with the EMA-workbench in Python. It is the first publicaly available ESDMA model with the use of Vensim PLE - Jan 22'. Feel free to explore the model behaviour.
